User experience is a crucial aspect of the project.

It is important that the platform is easy to navigate, visually appealing, and intuitive for users to interact with.

As a developer, you should always keep the user in mind when making decisions about the code base.

## Accessibility

The code should be accessible to users with disabilities.

- Include alt text for images and videos
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Use color contrast tools to make sure that the colors on the page are accessible
- Add keyboard navigation
- Add aria labels
- Use relative units of measurement

## Performance

The code should be optimized for performance.

- Use a CDN to serve static assets
- Use a service worker to cache assets
- Bundle assets in chunks
- Minify assets
